# RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline (Nextflow)

This repository contains a RNA-seq analysis pipeline I developed using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). It takes paired-end FASTQ files as input and processes them through quality control, trimming, alignment, and statistical analysis.

I created this as part of a project to better understand RNA-seq data analysis and workflow management with Nextflow. This can be used as a base or educational reference for similar projects. I also used some gtf and fa files from the GENCODE those can be changed the parts that I marked as #EDIT.

## Pipeline Steps

The workflow consists of the following main steps:

1. **FastQC** – run before trimming and after trimming to check read quality.
2. **Trim Galore** – detects low-quality reads and adapter sequences to remove them.
3. **STAR Indexing** – indexes the reference genome.
4. **STAR Alignment** – aligns trimmed reads to the genome.
5. **R Analysis** – an R script (`counts_and_tests.R`) that:
   - Generates count tables
   - Performs differential expression with `edgeR`
   - Uses `clusterProfiler` for enrichment analysis
   - Works with GTF annotations using `rtracklayer` and `org.Hs.eg.db`
   - Generates volcano and heatmap plots

The workflow is written in Nextflow DSL2 and uses Conda for reproducible environments.

## Running the Pipeline

### 1. Edit `nfrun.slurm`
Open the file and update the four parameters in the `nextflow run` command.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=testnf
#SBATCH --output=testnf_%j.out
#SBATCH --error=testnf_%j.err
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
#SBATCH --mem=72G
#SBATCH -p boyoz

# --- USER INPUTS (EDIT BELOW) ---
nextflow run mainuzay.nf \
  --reads "/data/fastq/*_{1,2}.fastq.gz" \        # EDIT
  --fasta "/refs/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa" \    # EDIT
  --gtf "/refs/gencode.v48.primary_assembly.basic.annotation.gtf" \ # EDIT
  --outdir "/project/results" \                   # EDIT
  -with-report "/project/results/summary_$(date +%F_%H-%M-%S).html" \
  -resume
```

## 2. Nextflow Script (`mainuzay.nf`)

The Nextflow workflow defines the full RNA-seq analysis process.  
You must provide the same **four required parameters** (`--reads`, `--fasta`, `--gtf`, `--outdir`) either:

- In the SLURM script (`nfrun.slurm`)
- Or directly on the Nextflow CLI

---

### Parameters in the Script
These are the defaults inside `mainuzay.nf` — you can edit them here **or** override via CLI.

```groovy
// --- USER INPUTS (EDIT THESE PATHS OR OVERRIDE VIA CLI) ---
params.reads  = "/archive/binokayl/Uzay/nftest/data/*_{1,2}.fastq.gz"    // EDIT
params.fasta  = "/archive/binokayl/Gencode/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa" // EDIT
params.gtf    = "/archive/binokayl/Gencode/gencode.v48.primary_assembly.basic.annotation.gtf" // EDIT
params.outdir = "/archive/binokayl/Uzay/nftest/results_2"                // EDIT
```
---

### 3. R Analysis Script (`counts_and_tests.R`)

This R script performs the downstream RNA-seq analysis after alignment and counting.
